<!-- 3) Write code that demonstrates the difference between let and const.
   Create two variables, one using let to store a student's grade (which can change) and
   another using const to store their name (which shouldn't change). Modify the grade 
   variable but attempt to modify the name variable. Observe the outcome. -->
